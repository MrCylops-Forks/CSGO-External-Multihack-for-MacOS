# CSGO External Multihack for MacOS

I wrote this code in early 2016 after I was bored with [iseekwonderful's csgoGlow](https://github.com/iseekwonderful/csgoGlow). At the time, this was the first multihack for MacOS.

All the work is mine except for BSP parsing that I pasted from [A5-'s CSGO-External](https://github.com/A5-/CSGO-External).

Features include:

- A clean base for reading/writing process memory
- No flash
- Glow (wallhack)
- Trigger for selected weapons
- Rapidfire for pistols
- Bunnyhop
- No recoil
- Aimbot

This project has been abandoned since September 2016. Do not expect anything to still work today.
